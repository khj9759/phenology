## Analyzing plant phenology near the Santa Clara River
Convey the significance of phenology in plant adaptation, highlighting the timing of life events and the impact of climate-driven shifts, while also noting the diverse phenological strategies employed by specific plant communities like riparian forests, grasslands, and chaparral shrublands.

### Visualizations

To investigate the phenology of these plant communities, we will analyze a time series of Landsat imagery coupled with polygons identifying the locations of study sites within each plant community.

### Highlights
- Transform spectral reflectance into a measure of vegetation productivity known as NDVI.
- Compute NDVI consistently throughout the year.
- Summarize NDVI values within different vegetation communities.
- Visualize alterations in NDVI within these vegetation communities.
