## Analyzing plant phenology near the Santa Clara River
Convey the significance of phenology in plant adaptation, highlighting the timing of life events and the impact of climate-driven shifts, while also noting the diverse phenological strategies employed by specific plant communities like riparian forests, grasslands, and chaparral shrublands.

### Visualizations

To investigate the phenology of these plant communities, we will analyze a time series of Landsat imagery coupled with polygons identifying the locations of study sites within each plant community.

### Highlights
- combining vector/raster data\
- compute and summarize NDVI value
- map and plot algebra\
